# Introducing Kite !


Kite is a gmail clone you can install on a server of your own. It's pretty limited for the moment: there's no sending functionality yet.
I hope to get something usable in the next few months.

Setup

For the moment, only Ubuntu server is supported. Debian should work as well.
After cloning the sources, run: fab setup myserver.example.com (you'll need to have installed fabric)
For more details, like how to setup your DNS servers, see <LINK to blog post>


How can I contribute?

The code and the issues are hosted on github. You can also shoot me an email at kite~khamidou.com (replace ~ with @ - sorry for the obfuscation, I haven't setup spam filtering yet) for suggestions or improvements.
