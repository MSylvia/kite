                    <p>
                        Kite doesn't do much for the moment. Basically, it can display the emails in your mailbox.

                        Clicking in on a conversation opens the conversation view :

                            <h3>Why?</h3>
                        </a>
     
                        <p>
                            I really like gmail. I use it a <i>lot</i>. Google got a lot of things right when they designed it. 
                            However I'd like to be in control of my data, and to host it in on my own server.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            A few months ago I decided to set up my own mail server so I started shopping around for potential solutions. 
                            A lot of the components that make an email server already work : Postfix for email handling, 
                            Dovecot for IMAP, Spamassassin for SPAM and ElasticSearch for searching. 
                       </p>
                       <p>
                           Unfortunately, I didn't find a webmail that would cut it, so I decided to write my own. 
                           After a few months of coding, kite was born!
                       </p>
                        <p>
                        Kite is still very much alpha software : it can only display individual messages. I hope to get something a lot more useable in the next few months, though. I'll start with threading, gmail-style, and the old school compose.
                        </p>

                        Kite uses puppet for deployments. This means that deploying a new mail server, including a postfix config with sensible defaults, can be done in minutes !

                        The frontend is written in Javascript with AngularJS, and the backend is in python2.

                        I use Jasmine and unittest.py for the tests.
