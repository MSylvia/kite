                        Kite doesn't do much for the moment. Basically, it can display the emails in your mailbox.

                        The general view looks a lot like gmail but barer :

                        <h3>Setup</h3>
                    </a>

                    <p>
                    Setting up Kite is pretty easy. The only tricky part is the DNS.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Setting up your machine</h4>
                    <p>
                        You'll need a machine (real or virtual) to install Kite on.
                        Install Ubuntu server 12.04LTS on it.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Setting up the DNS</h4>

                    <p>
                        Let's say you own the domain "example.com" and you want to host a Kite instance at <code>mail.example.com</code>. Let's also say that your server's IP address is <code>192.168.50.4</code>.

                    You'll have to modify your domain's DNS configuration on your registrar's website.
                    Unfortunately, all registrars have different and sometimes very confusing interfaces. To add to this,
                    DNS is complicated too.

                    Here's what you'll have to add to your DNS config:
                    <ul>
                        <li>one A record to point to your server's IP address.</li>
                        <li>one MX record, with priority 10 </li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                    <h4>Installing Kite</h4>

<pre>
git clone http://github.com/khamidou/kite # Get the latest sources
cd kite
fab setup -u username -H myhostname.example.com
</pre>
 
                    <p>
                        I really like gmail. I use it a <i>lot</i>. Google got a lot of things right when they designed it. 
                        However I'd like to be in control of my data, and to host it in on my own server.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        A few months ago I decided to set up my own mail server so I started shopping around for potential solutions. 
                        A lot of the components that make an email server already work : Postfix for email handling, 
                        Dovecot for IMAP, Spamassassin for SPAM and ElasticSearch for searching. 
                   </p>
                   <p>
                       Unfortunately, I didn't find a webmail that would cut it, so I decided to write my own. 
                       After a few months of coding, kite was born!
                   </p>
                    <p>
                    Kite is still very much alpha software : it can only display individual messages. I hope to get something a lot more useable in the next few months, though. I'll start with threading, gmail-style, and the old school compose.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Will it be easy to install?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Kite uses puppet for deployments. This means that deploying a new mail server, including a postfix config with sensible defaults, can be done in minutes ! 
                    </p>

                   <h3>How can I contribute?</h3>
                    <p>
                        The code and the issues are hosted on <a href="https://github.com/khamidou/kite">Github</a>.

                        The frontend is written in Javascript with AngularJS, and the backend is in python2.

                    <p>
                        I use Jasmine and unittest.py for the tests.
