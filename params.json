{"name":"Kite","tagline":"Kite is a modern webmail","body":"## Kite, a modern webmail\r\n\r\nKite is a webmail designed to look a lot like gmail and to be easily deployable on a single server.\r\nIt's written in Javascript with Angularjs for the frontend, and in Python 2 for the backend.\r\n\r\nThis is very much alpha software, but I hope to have something usable in a couple months.\r\n\r\nYou can see a demo [here](http://dogfood.kiteapp.io).\r\n\r\n### How to run it\r\n\r\nTo run it, you'll need to have [vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) installed.\r\nWhen it's done, run:\r\n\r\n    vagrant up\r\n\r\nAfter this, browse to http://192.168.50.4 . You should be greeted by a login window. Use whatever username/password combination to login.\r\n\r\nThe host name of the vagrant box is kitebox.dev. You should probably add it to\r\nyour (host) machine /etc/hosts.\r\n\r\n### Contact/Help\r\n\r\nI can be reached at contact@khamidou.com. It try to do my best to reply to all incoming email, but sometimes it may slip through.\r\n\r\nregards,\r\n\r\nKarim Hamidou\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
